# Cotação Dólar Extension

A simple Chrome extension that displays the **Dollar to Real** exchange rate, sourced directly from the **USDT/BRL pair on Binance**. This extension was created as a response to the unexpected removal of real-time Dollar exchange rate information from Google’s search results in late December 2024.

## Motivation

Towards the end of 2024, the Dollar experienced a sharp rise in relation to the Brazilian Real. On December 25, 2024 (a public holiday), Google briefly showed an unusually high exchange rate for the Real against the Dollar. Shortly afterward:

- Google **suspended the display of the Real exchange rate** in relation to other currencies.  
- A lawsuit from the Attorney General's Office of the Federal Union of Brazil (case number **00405162030202431**, access code **c53b52b1**) was filed, leading to an official letter sent on December 26, 2024, to Google’s General Director in Brazil about inconsistencies in the displayed exchange rate.  
- There is widespread speculation that Google was **informally pressured** to halt displaying Dollar exchange rates, allegedly to **mask the Real’s devaluation**.

In response to this climate of uncertainty, **Cotação Dólar Extension** was developed. It aims to provide an **independent, reliable** source for the Dollar-to-Real exchange rate—helping users stay informed despite any external pressures or data suppression.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur)

Using Volar ensures the TypeScript language service is properly aware of `.vue` types.

---

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript does not handle type information for `.vue` imports by default. This project replaces the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In your editor (e.g., VSCode), use [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) instead of Vetur for the best experience.
